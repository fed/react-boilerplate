## Development Tasks

| Command | Description |

## Project Structure

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

For the project to build, these files must exist with exact filenames:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename any of the other files.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.
